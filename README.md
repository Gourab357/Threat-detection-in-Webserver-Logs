# Threat-detection-in-Webserver-Logs
This project explores threat detection in web server logs, starting with traditional statistical models and a DistilRoBERTa baseline. The main contribution is an enhanced feature engineering pipeline using SBERT semantic embeddings, topic extraction, GRU sequence modeling, and threat mapping to better identify suspicious behavior.
